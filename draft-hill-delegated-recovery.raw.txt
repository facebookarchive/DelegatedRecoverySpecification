Abstract

   Delegated Account Recovery allows an application to delegate the
   capability to recover an account (e.g. in the event of a credential
   loss or compromise) to an account controlled by the same user or
   entity at a third party service provider.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

1.1.1.  Presentation Language

   This document deals with the formatting of tokens in an external
   representation using a casually defined syntax drawing from that used
   in [RFC5246] and resembling the programming language "C".  The
   purpose is to document the binary token format only.

   The basic numeric data type is an unsigned byte (uint8).  All larger
   numeric data types are formed from fixed-length series of bytes
   concatenated from left to right and are also unsigned.  The following
   numeric types are predefined.

           uint8 uint16[2];
           uint8 uint32[4];
           uint8 uint64[8];

   All values, here and elsewhere in the specification, are stored in
   network byte (big-endian) order; the uint32 represented by the hex
   bytes 01 02 03 04 is equivalent to the decimal value 16909060.

   The type string is defined as a concatenated sequence of octet
   sequences representing ASCII characters, one per octet.  [RFC3629]

   The term URL is defined by reference to [RFC3986] in this document.
   "URL" is used deliberately in preference to "URI" as all such objects
   in this document are used to access network resources and such
   objects as used by this document lack any persistent meaning after
   the resource to which they refer ceases to exist.

1.2.  Challenges with Existing Account Recovery Solutions

   Network services that rely on user credentials must also cope with
   the reality that users may forget or lose exclusive control of these
   credentials.  As a consequence, nearly every such service must
   implement an alternate authentication process to enable a user to
   recover control of an account.  In practice, there are few good
   options for doing this, and these recovery flows are often the
   weakest link in securing accounts.

1.2.1.  Recovery Questions

   A common and self-contained method of account recovery is to ask the
   user additional questions that they are less likely to forget the
   answer to than a more arbitrary password.  The same features that
   make such a question useful for recovery also reduce its security:

   o  Things that are memorable may often not be fully private.  Friends
      and family members likely know the answers to many such questions,
      and for highly public figures it may be possible to research this
      information.

   o  Allowing users to select their own questions may result in
      questions with a small possible domain of answers (favorite color,
      favorite superhero) that make brute force guessing highly
      effective, even if rate-limiting is applied.

   o  Choosing questions that are both secure and memorable is
      difficult, and common choices of subject matter may not be
      applicable across cultural contexts (mother's maiden name, name of
      a pet), age ranges (first car) or other differentiating
      characteristics of large and diverse audiences.

   o  The limited selection of questions which are both memorable and
      applicable to the broadest possible audience makes re-use of these
      questions and answers common among many service providers, with
      attendant risks that disclosure of answers to a malicious party by
      any provider may compromise many accounts at unrelated providers.
      Furthermore it is difficult for a user to change their answers in
      the event of such a compromise.

1.2.2.  Password Hints

   Password hints are extremely problematic - by definition they must be
   revealed to an unauthenticated user, which implies reversibly
   encrypted storage at best, reveals information about a password (or
   often the password itself), and common hints at multiple services may
   reveal where a password is reused, facilitating further attacks.

1.2.3.  Email Recovery

   Users are unlikely to forget their email address, and a common
   practice is to email the user URL that encodes the ability to recover
   the account.  This is the most widely deployed mechanism at the time
   of this writing, but it has a number of shortcomings.

   o  Forcing users to everywhere use an email address has privacy
      implications, potentially allowing service providers to collude to
      track individuals' activity across many domains.

   o  Email addresses are not universal, and are becoming less so.
      Especially in the developing world or with younger audiences,
      email may not be the first network service individuals provision
      for themselves, if they provision it at all.

   o  Email addresses get recycled and reassigned to new owners.

   o  Users may use a weakly-secured email addresses when signing up for
      a new service, for example an address maintained to collect the
      unwanted commercial correspondence often expected to result from
      signing up for a new online service.

   o  Email does not provide guarantees of deliverability or end-to-end
      transport security.  An adversary performing pervasive
      surveillance may likely be able to abuse such weaknesses.

   o  Emails in large organizations are rarely private to their
      recipient.  In addition to the commonplace that high-value
      accounts belonging to executives may be accessible by their
      assistants, the contents and especially links in the email of
      every user in a modern organization may commonly be logged for
      legal discovery purposes, or crawled to identify malware and
      phishing attacks.

   o  The capabilities of an emailed reset link must be encoded in the
      GET string to ensure compatibility with non-HTML capable mail user
      agents, and so may leak in the HTTP Referer header to any other
      content included in a recovery page. (e.g. an analytics script
      hosted at a third-party origin)

   o  Users are commonly authenticated to email services all the time on
      many devices.  Account recovery through email is an unstructured
      process which does not ensure the user was strongly authenticated
      for a high-risk action.  A simple password compromise, or even
      brief loss of control of an unlocked device where the user is
      logged in, may be sufficient to transitively compromise many other
      accounts of the user.  If the only way to notify the user that
      their account was reset is back through the same email channel, an
      attacker can easily cover their tracks.

   o  The wide diversity of mail user agents means that even if account
      recovery emails could be detected heuristically by providers or
      explicitly identified with metadata from senders, it would be
      remain difficult for email providers to apply special treatment to
      such messages.

   o  An attacker that compromises a user's account may change the email
      address associated with it.  Without very carefully designed
      processes, it may be impossible for the genuine user to recover
      their account after such a change if recovery flows are purely
      email-based.

   o  Email recovery flows cannot be used to recover capabilities, such
      as cryptographic keys, that may be necessary to use an account
      (e.g. a network-based file store that offers encrypted files) but
      which the user does not want the account provider to have access
      to at all times.

1.2.4.  Federated Authentication

   Federated systems for authentication take many forms and solve the
   problem of account recovery (or at least delegate it implicitly to
   the Identity Provider).  However, after fifteen years of widespread
   deployment of such systems, we see few mainstream services that are
   willing to rely exclusively on federated logins for a variety of
   reasons.

   o  A user may be unwilling to disclose their identity, other
      information, or grant permissions to a new service they have just
      begun to use and about which they have not yet formed an opinion
      of its value or trustworthiness.

   o  A service may be unwilling to depend on a third-party for access
      to its customer base.  They may view "owning" their relationship
      with the customer as having business value, may have a regulatory
      mandate to do so, or may not want to be beholden to the
      availability of a third party for their most important customer
      interactions.

   o  A service may view providers of federated login services as
      competitors or potential competitors, and not wish to disclose
      information about how often users are logging on, who their most
      active users are or not desire to show a competitor's logo as part
      of their login process.

1.2.5.  Alternate Methods

   Methods do exist to strongly re-authenticate an account holder in the
   absence of a password or other primary credential.  Device-based or
   multi-factor authentication, multi-device authentication, or trusted
   connections in a social network are possibilities.  Unfortunately, of
   the potentially hundreds of services a user interacts with in a year,
   only a few are likely able to leverage such factors.  The rest will
   lack the information, resources, and user consent needed.
   Furthermore, the characteristics that make good recovery systems
   strong also may make them unique to a particular service, preventing
   broad adoption as a best practice by other providers.

1.3.  Relationship to Other Protocols

   Delegated Recovery is similar in some respects to OAuth [RFC5849]and
   related protocols.

   It is not constructed simply as a profile of one these protocols as
   it relies on different trust semantics.  Because tokens granting an
   account recovery capability are expected to have an indefinite
   lifetime and should be able to remain valid even following the
   compromise and/or rotation of the keys they were originally issued
   under, tokens in this protocol derive their authority at a point in
   time from being signed with currently published public keys,
   discoverable over HTTPS.

   As this trust model is different than other protocols in the broad
   OAuth family, profiling an existing protocol to fit these needs would
   likely be considerably more complex than implementing a new,
   minimalist protocol from scratch.  As such, the latter approach has
   been taken here.

1.4.  Goals

   Goals for Delegated Account Recovery include:

   o  Allow network services that do not have the resources or
      information to build a secure and usable account recovery process
      to delegate the function to network services that can.

   o  Allow users to choose to use service providers that can strongly
      re-authenticate them to recover accounts at other services.

   o  Disclose as little information as possible, and no more than is
      necessary, to protocol participants.

   o  As much as possible, require multiple points of failure in order
      for accounts to be compromised through the recovery process.

   o  Be resilient in the face of compromises, including loss of
      exclusive control of cryptographic key material, and allow re-
      establishment of trust in stored recovery capabilities without
      user action.

   o  Provide, through the protocol semantics, explicit information
      about security-critical account actions and information flow
      between providers to enable better auditing, anomaly detection and
      remediation in the event of compromises.

   o  Allow users to set up a durable recovery capability when in
      control of their account, which can be exercised even after
      malicious changes to the account (such as changing an associated
      email address or personal information) following a compromise.

1.5.  Roles

   Delegated Recovery defines three roles:

   User
      The entity in control of the accounts.

   Account Provider
      The network service at which a user has an account they need to
      establish a recovery capability for.

   Recovery Provider
      The network service which offers the delegated account recovery
      service, and at which a user has an account and wishes to use to
      recover control of other accounts.

                Figure 1: Recovery Capability Establishment

   The abstract Delegated Recovery capability establishment flow
   illustrated in Figure 1 describes the interaction between the three
   roles and includes the following steps:

   1.  The User, having already established control of an account with
       the Account Provider, indicates to the Account Provider which
       Recovery Provider they would like to use.

   2.  The Account Provider makes a GET request to determine if the
       service of the user's choice offers the Delegated Recovery
       service and what its protocol endpoint URLs are.  This step may
       be unnecesssary if the Account Provider already knows the
       configuration for the chosen Recovery Provider.

   3.  The Account Provider generates a recovery token for the User and
       Recovery Provider.

   4.  The Account Provider sends the Token to the User Agent with
       instructions to deliver it to the Recovery Provider URL indicated
       in the configuration.

   5.  Upon receiving the Token, the Recovery Provider authenticates the
       user if they are not logged in.

   6.  The Recovery Provider makes a GET request to the Account Provider
       to discover its public keys and protocol URLs.

   7.  The Recovery Provider validates the signature on the token and
       saves it.

   8.  The Recovery Provider optionally notifies the Account Provider of
       the status of the operation.

   9.  The Recovery Provider redirects the user agent back to the
       callback URL indicated by the configuration with a status code.

                Figure 2: Exercising a Recovery Capability

   The abstract flow depicting the exercising of a Delegated Recovery
   capability in Figure 2 describes the interaction between the the
   roles and includes the following steps:

   1.   The user initiates a recovery, either at the Account Provider,
        or with the Recovery Provider.

   2.   (optional) the Account Provider GETs the current configuration
        for the Recovery Provider to be used.

   3.   (optional) The Account Provider offers or redirects the user to
        the Recovery Provider's endpoint, with a hint of the origin of
        the account the User wants to recover.

   4.   The Recovery Provider authenticates the user appropriately for
        conducting a recovery transaction.

   5.   The Recovery Provider makes a GET request to discover the
        current URL for exercising recovery at the Account Provider.

   6.   The Recovery Provider counter-signs the token and additional
        fields with its published key.

   7.   The Recovery Provider sends the user agent to the Account
        Provider's recovery URL with the counter-signed token.

   8.   The Account Provider receives a token, and retrieves the
        Recovery Provider's current configuration to discover its keys.

   9.   The Account Provider validates the counter-signature, additional
        fields, its originally issued token, and takes any other
        necessary steps to complete risk-appropriate re-authentication
        of the user.

   10.  The Account Provider restores control of the account to the user
        and allows a new primary authentication method or credential to
        be established.

1.7.  TLS Version

   Whenever Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used by this
   specification, the appropriate version (or versions) of TLS will vary
   over time, based on the widespread deployment and known security
   vulnerabilities.  At the time of this writing, TLS version 1.2
   [RFC5246]is the most recent and widely deployed version.

   Implementations may also support additional transport-layer security
   mechanisms that meet their security requirements.

1.8.  HTTP Redirections

   This specification makes extensive use of HTTP redirections, in which
   the client or the authorization server directs the resource owner's
   user-agent to another destination.  While the examples in this
   specification show the use of the HTTP 302 status code, any other
   method available via the user-agent to accomplish this redirection is
   allowed and is considered to be an implementation detail.

   When retrieving configuration servers SHOULD NOT follow redirects to
   reduce the risk of Server Side Request Forgery.

1.9.  Application User Agents

   This specification is written primarily for a general purpose web
   browser as user agent but this is not the only possible
   implementation choice.  On some platforms, some of either or both of
   the Account Provider and Recovery Provider functionality may be
   provided as part of a dedicated, platform-native application, AKA an
   "app".  Generally, as the protocol aims to coordinate between
   authenticated sessions at multiple service providers, the platform
   standard web browser is the most standardized and convenient
   mechanism available and should be preferred.

2.  Fetching Configuration

   Fetching Configuration is the process of determining the protocol
   endpoints and public keys used by Account Providers and Recovery
   Providers.

   Service providers may indicate that configuration responses are
   cacheable and may cache responses but cache lifetimes should be kept
   reasonably short to enable timely responses to events such as key
   compromise.

   Fetching configuration begins by normalizing the service provider to
   be used into an RFC6454[RFC6454] ASCII serialization of an Origin
   with an "https" scheme.

   Retrieval of the configuration is done using an HTTP "GET" request to
   the provider's configuration endpoint at the following absolute path
   relative to the https:// Origin.
   "/.well-known/delegated-account-recovery/configuration"

   The configuration resource path on the http:// scheme MUST NOT
   redirect to the https:// protocol, as this may mask configuration
   mistakes by consumers.  Servers MUST return an empty response body
   and an HTTP status code in the 400 range (401 is recommended) if
   "/.well-known/delegated-account-recovery/configuration" is accessed
   with the http:// scheme

   When fetching configuration, service providers MUST NOT follow
   redirects that do not use an https:// scheme.  Service providers
   generally should avoid utilizing redirects when returning
   configuration responses.  As it is not mandatory that the issuer
   field or endpoints in a configuration agree with the origin of the
   configuration URL, directly returning the canonical data rather than
   a redirect reduces latency in the protocol.

   A Recovery Provider MUST return the following information in a JSON
   dictionary comprising the entire response body:

   +-------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
   | name                          | value                             |

   |                               | MUST have an https: scheme        |

   +-------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

   * NOTE: A Recovery Provider may also impose per-account limitations
   on the total storage or number of recovery tokens it allows.  The
   token-max-size property only sets an upper bound on the length of a
   single token, and it may still reject tokens below this bound for
   reasons not discoverable in public configuration.

   An Account Provider MUST return the following information in a JSON
   dictionary comprising the entire response body:

   +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+

   +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+

   An origin that acts as both an Account and a Recovery provider MUST
   return a single JSON dictionary as the entire response body
   containing all required keys.

   URLs [RFC3986]MUST have a scheme component that is "https", a host
   component, and optionally, port and path components, and no query or
   fragment components.  Note that no relationship can be assumed
   between the host component of the "issuer" input and those of of the
   URLs in the configuration. (e.g. "https://www.messenger.com" might
   have account recovery endpoints at "https://www.facebook.com")

3.  Protocol Endpoints

   Each phase (establishing, and exercising, an account recovery
   capability) utilizes three protocol endpoints.  (HTTP resources)

   All protocol endpoints MUST use the https:// scheme, and the protocol
   endpoint paths at the http:// scheme MUST NOT redirect to the
   https:// protocol, as this may mask configuration mistakes by
   clients.  A GET or POST to protocol endpoint paths using the http://
   scheme MUST yield an empty response body and an HTTP status code 401.

   When establishing a recovery capability, the following endpoints are
   used:

   o  "Save Token" at the Recovery Provider is the endpoint to which the
      Account Provider will instruct the user agent to deliver the
      Recovery Token.

   o  "Save Token Async IFrame API" is a URL from which an HTML resource
      supporting an async postMessage API for saving tokens can be
      loaded.

   o  "Save Token Return" is the endpoint at the Account Provider where
      the Recovery Provider redirects the user agent after processing an
      invocation of the "Save Token" endpoint.

   When exercising a recovery capability, the following endpoints are
   used:

   o  "Recover Account" at the Recovery Provider is the endpoint at
      which the User will initiate an account recovery action at an
      Account Provider.  The User may be directed to this resource by
      the Recovery Provider, or the Account Provider may utilize
      published configuration to direct the User to this endpoint.

   o  "Recover Account Return" is the endpoint at the Account Provider
      where the Recovery Provider redirects the user agent with a
      counter-signed recovery token to complete the recovery of their
      account

   Additionally, an Account Provider may optionally provide a "Token
   Status" endpoint at a well-known location to allow the Recovery
   Provider to provide direct status updates for tokens, such as the
   success or failure of saving a token, token deletion, or repudiation
   of the exercise of a recovery capability.

3.1.  Save Token Endpoint

   "save-token" is used to interact with the Recovery Provider and save
   a recovery token for later use.  The Recovery Provider MUST first
   authenticate the User.  The way in which the Recovery Provider
   authenticates the User is beyond the scope of this specification.

   Save Token endpoints which expect to receive invocations by web user
   agents MUST support the HTTP "POST" method and SHOULD reject the HTTP
   "GET" method.

   If navigating from an Account Provider implemented as a native app to
   a general purpose web browser and POST is not available, the Account
   Provider SHOULD first navigate the user agent to a resource under its
   control and use that resource to perform the POST.

   The POST body MUST be "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" formatted.
   It MUST contain a parameter "token" containing the recovery token.

   The POST body MAY contain the additional parameter 'login_hint'.
   This value may be set to indicate the Account Provider's notion of
   the primary contact point for the user.  A Recovery Provider might
   match this against the currently logged in user to determine what UI
   treatments, if any, to apply to confirm saving of the recovery token.

   The POST body MAY contain the additional parameter
   'login_hint_sha256'.  This value may be set to indicate the Account
   Provider's notion of the primary contact point for the user.  A
   Recovery Provider might match this against the currently logged in
   user to determine what UI treatments, if any, to apply to confirm
   saving of the recovery token.  The value should contain the base64
   encoded concatenation of a 256 bit random salt value with the binary
   output of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm applied to the concatenation
   of the salt and an octet string representing the ASCII serialization
   of the primary contact point hint for the user at the Account
   Provider.  Use of 'login_hint_sha256', when compared to 'login_hint',
   allows matching without disclosure, but introduces the possibility
   that legitimate matches will not be discovered due to differences in
   how contact point hints are represented or canonicalized before
   hashing.

   The POST body MAY contain an additional parameter 'nickname_hint' to
   suggest a nickname for the account to which the token relates.

   The POST body MAY contain an additional parameter 'confirmation'.  If
   set to the value 'required', this indicates to the Recovery Provider
   that it SHOULD show some form of interstitial explicitly informing
   the user that a token will be saved, with the option to decline.

   The POST body type MAY contain an additional parameter, 'obsoletes'.
   The value of the 'obsoletes' is a token id which the current token is
   intended to replace.  If the user at the Recovery Provider has a
   saved token with an id and issuer matching this property, it should
   be deleted or marked as invalid if the new token is successfully
   saved.

   The POST body MAY contain an additional parameter 'state', the value
   of which will be passed to the 'save-token-return' endpoint,
   unmodified.

3.1.1.  Processing Instructions

   When a user wishes to save a recovery token, the Account Provider
   takes the following processing steps:

   1.  Authenticate the User.  The exact nature of how the Account
       Provider authenticates the User is beyond the scope of this
       specification.

   2.  Obtain and normalize an origin with an "https" scheme from the
       user indicating the domain of their chosen Recovery Provider.
       Users might indicate this choice by picking among pre-configured
       options, entering a domain name, or it might be inferred from the
       domain portion of an email address.

   3.  Retrieve the Recovery Provider configuration as described in
       Section 2.

   4.  If necessary configuration cannot be obtained, abort these steps.

   5.  Prepare a recovery token as described in Section 4.  Use the
       'issuer' field of the retrieved configuration as the value of the
       'audience' field in the token.

   6.  The Account Provider may save the token_id and audience fields
       from the token associated with the User's account, to assist the
       user in completing a recovery process at a future time.

   7.  The Account Provider should have some method of mapping an issued
       recovery token to the original public key it was issued under and
       any key used to encrypt the opaque data, to be able to complete
       the protocol when the token is returned.  This might be
       maintained as server-side state, or key ids might be encoded into
       the token_id field.

   8.  Instruct the user's agent to POST the token to the Save Token
       endpoint at the Recovery Provider.  The Account Provider may
       choose to do this in a new browsing context. (e.g. a popup)

   Upon receiving an invocation of the Save Token endpoint the Recovery
   Provider takes the following processing steps:

   1.   Authenticate the User.  The exact nature of how the Recovery
        Provider authenticates the User is beyond the scope of this
        specification.

   2.   Parse the token.

   3.   Validate that the version value is 0.

   4.   Validate that the type value is 0.

   5.   Retrieve the Account Provider configuration as described in
        Section 2 using the issuer field of the token as the subject.
        HTTP redirects SHOULD NOT be followed.

   6.   Validate that the value of the issuer field of the configuration
        matches the value of the issuer field of the recovery token.

   7.   Validate the signature over the token according to processing
        rules for the algorithm implied by the version.

   8.   Validate that the audience field of the token identifies an
        origin which the provider considers itself authoritative for.
        (Often the audience will be same-origin with the Recovery
        Provider, but other values may be acceptable, e.g.
        "https://mail.example.com" and "https://social.example.com" may
        be acceptable audiences for "https://recovery.example.com".)

   9.   Validate that the timestamp is fresh within an acceptable clock
        skew.

   10.  If a token binding is present or required, validate that it is
        acceptable.

   11.  Save the token for the User.  The means by which a Recovery
        Provider saves the token is beyond the scope of this
        specification.

   12.  Because recovery tokens do not reveal the account name at the
        Account Provider, and because a User might have multiple
        accounts, Recovery Providers may give the User an option to add
        attach a nickname (e.g. "home", "work") or other means of
        identifying the account the token is associated with.

   13.  When the user has completed the operation successfully, or if
        the user aborted or abandoned the operation, or if the operation
        cannot be completed due to an unrecoverable error, if the
        token's "status_requested" field is 1, the Recovery Provider MAY
        invoke the Token Status endpoint "token-status" for the "save-
        success" or "save-failure" status, as appropriate, following the
        processing instructions for that operation described below.

   14.  Redirect the User or user agent to the "save-token-return"
        endpoint defined by the Account Provider configuration,
        including the GET parameter "status" set to the value "save-
        success" or "save-failure" to report whether a token was
        successfully saved, regardless of whether asynchronous status
        updates for the token were requested.

   15.  If a 'state' parameter was included with the original request,
        send its value, unmodified, as an additional parameter in the
        redirect.

3.2.  Save Token Return Endpoint

   Save Token Return is used to return the User to the Account Provider
   after invoking Save Token at the Recovery Provider.

   Save Token Return endpoints MUST support both the HTTP "GET" and
   "POST" methods.

   Upon receiving an invocation of the Save Token Return endpoint the
   Recovery Provider may use the "status" parameter to report whether a
   token was successfully saved, regardless of whether asynchronous
   status updates for the token were requested.  The 'state' parameter
   may be used, if needed, to determine the next action to be taken.

3.3.  Save Token Async API Endpoint

   In order to facilitate greater control over the user experience for
   an Account Provider, or to expose advanced features, a Recovery
   Provider may optionally provide as part of its configuration a save-
   token-async-api-iframe URL.

   This URL may be used as the src attribute of an <iframe> tag in an
   HTML document.  When loaded, the resource MUST expose an API based on
   HTML cross-document messaging.
   (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#web-messaging)

   The details of how such a resource communicates with services at the
   Recovery Provider are not normatively specified by this document.

   The normative API exposed is as follows:

3.3.1.  Asynchronous Message Contract

   The "message" argument to "postMessage()" MUST be a JSON object.

   Messages related to this API MUST always contain the property
   'delegated-account-recovery-api-message' with a value indicating the
   type of the protocol message.

   The following message types are defined by their literal string
   values:

   ready
       Sent by API to parent to indicate it is ready to receive
       messages.

   save-token
       Sent to API to initiate a token save operation that completes the
       operation and returns results by navigating the parent frame.

   save-token-no-navigation
       Sent to API to initiate a token save operation.  Calls of this
       type MUST NOT result in the parent frame being navigated.
       Results are returned with a 'save-token-result' message.

   save-token-async-only
       Sent to API to initiate a token save operation.  Calls of this
       type MUST NOT result in the parent frame being navigated.
       Results are returned with a 'save-token-result' message.

   save-token-result
       Sent by API to parent frame to indicate completion status of a
       'save-token-no-navigation' or 'save-token-async-only' message.

   get-binding
       Sent to API to retrieve a token binding.

   binding
       Sent by API to parent in response to a 'get-binding' message to
       convey a token binding string.

   For messages that elicit a response, the Account Provider may set an
   'id' property on the message.  If present, the Recovery Provider MUST
   include its value as the value of the property 'in-reply-to' in the
   correlated response.

   The Account Provider SHOULD set the targetOrigin parameter to the
   origin of the URL obtained from the Recovery Provider configuration,
   to reduce the risk that messages will be visibile to unintended
   recpiients.

   On loading, the async API resource MUST post a message to its parent
   of type 'ready'.

3.3.1.1.  save-token message

   This message type MUST have an additional property, 'token', that
   contains the base64 encoded recovery token to be saved.

   This message type MAY contain the additional property 'login_hint'.
   These values may be set to indicate the Account Provider's notion of
   the primary contact points for the user.  A Recovery Provider might
   match these against the currently logged in user to determine what UI
   treatments, if any, to apply to confirm saving of the recovery token.

   This message type MAY contain an additional property 'nickname_hint'
   to suggest a nickname for the account to which the token relates.

   This message type MAY contain an additional property 'state' which
   will be passed, unmodified, as part of the redirect to the 'save-
   token-return' endpoint.

   This message type MAY contain an additional property, 'obsoletes'.
   The value of the 'obsoletes' property is a token id which the current
   token is intended to replace.  If the user at the Recovery Provider
   has a saved token with an id and issuer matching this property, it
   should be deleted or marked as invalid if the new token is
   successfully saved.

   If no other keys are set on the message, the behavior of the Recovery
   Provider iframe will be to process the message and navigate the
   parent frame based on the results of that processing.

   If the Recovery Provider needs to perform additional interactions
   with the user to complete saving the token, (such as login,
   confirmation of the save or collecting a token nickname) it can
   redirect the parent window to whatever location is necessary to
   complete the flow interactively at the Recovery Provider.  It SHOULD
   always attempt to return the user to the Account Provider's save-
   token-return endpoint at the end of these flows, with the provided
   'state' parameter, whether successful or not.

   If the recovery token can be saved without user interaction, the
   iframe SHOULD navigate the parent frame directly to the Account
   Provider's save-token-return endpoint with the status parameter set
   to 'save-success' and any 'state' parameter set.

3.3.1.2.  save-token-no-navigation message

   This message has identical arguments to the 'save-token' message.

   It is processed identically, except it MUST NOT navigate the parent
   frame.  Instead, results are conveyed by it issuing a postMessage()
   to its parent window with a message of type 'save-token-result' and a
   'result' property.

   This method may be preferred by a caller that wants to guarantee the
   user isn't navigated away from a critical experience they are
   interacting with, like an account creation funnel.  The account
   provider might choose to, e.g. open a popup with a POST directly to
   the 'save-token' endpoint to complete any interaction with the
   Recovery Provider if the value of 'result' is not 'save-success'.

   The value of the 'state' property on the message, if set, is ignored.

3.3.1.3.  save-token-async-only message

   This message has identical arguments to the 'save-token' message.

   It is processed identically, except that instead of navigating the
   parent frame, it issues a postMessage() to its parent window
   immediately after the message is accepted, with a message type of
   'save-token-result' and a 'result' property.  The only valid value
   for the 'result' key in response to a 'save-token-async-only' message
   is 'done'.  No indication is provided of the success or failure of
   the operation.

   How a message is determined to be accepted is an implementation
   detail at the discretion of the Recovery Provider.  It might reject
   messages locally (e.g. if it does not support silent acceptance for
   this Account Provider or the user), it might dispatch them
   immediately using an API like Beacon, if available, or it may need to
   make an asynchronous HTTP request and wait for a response.  It SHOULD
   indicate "done" to the caller at the earliest practical moment.

   This protocol message would typically be employed with a token that
   sets the 'status-requested' flag and by an Account Provider that
   keeps track of what recovery tokens have been recorded for an
   account.  It might be used to optimistically enroll users in recovery
   as part of another action, with an offer to complete the flow
   interactively at a later time made to users not successfully enrolled
   asynchronously.

   The value of the 'state' property on the message, if set, is ignored.

3.3.1.4.  save-token-result message

   This message is sent to the parent frame in response to a 'save-
   token-no-navigation' or 'save-token-async-only' message.

   This message contains a 'result' property.  If sent in response to a
   'save-token-no-navigation' message, the value of result will be
   either 'save-token-success' or 'save-token-failure', indicating
   whether the token was saved without user interaction.  If sent in
   response to a 'save-token-async-only' message, the value is always
   'done', indicating when it is safe to navigate or otherwise destroy
   the iframe hosting the API.

3.3.1.5.  get-binding message

   This message indicates a request for a token binding string from the
   Recovery Provider.  The reply contains a string that should be
   treated as opaque by the receiver and placed into the 'binding' field
   of a recovery token.

   Bindings are optional according to this specification but individual
   Recovery Providers MAY, at their discretion, require a token contain
   a valid binding to be saved.

   Bindings SHOULD be considered to be unique and single-use and the
   string received in response to a call to 'get-binding' SHOULD NOT be
   associated to more than one token.

   This message has no arguments other than the optional 'id' for reply
   correlation.

3.3.1.6.  binding message

   This message replies to a 'get-binding' message.

   The API MUST provide a response to such a message.  An empty string
   is a valid binding string.

   The property 'binding' of this message contains the binding string.

   A recipient of this message SHOULD treat it as unique and single-use,
   but the API implementation MAY return the same binding string for
   multiple invocations at the same instance of the iframe resource.

3.3.1.7.  Implementation Considerations

   Recovery Providers are not required to process all APIs uniformly.
   For example, a Recovery Provider might refuse to process 'save-token-
   async-only' messages from certain issuers, or only attempt to process
   them if the Account Provider is the canonical owner of the users's
   primary contact point at the Recovery Provider. (e.g. a Recovery
   Provider might silently accept a recovery token from
   https://example.com only if it's own view of the authenticated user
   had a confirmed email address at example.com)

3.3.1.8.  Privacy Considerations

   Implementers should take caution that the binding message does not
   leak information about a user.  It SHOULD NOT provide the same or a
   correlatable response across different instances of the iframe
   resource implementing the API, and SHOULD NOT provide bindings that
   are distinguishable by callers based on user state or properties.
   (logged in, user identifier, user IP address, etc)

3.4.  Recover Account Endpoint

   The Recover Account endpoint is used to exercise a saved recovery
   capability.

   A user may arrive at the Recover Account Endpoint in at least two
   ways:

   o  The user deliberately visits the Recovery Provider and requests,
      through a means outside the scope of this specification, to view
      all of their saved tokens or those for a particular Account
      Provider.

   o  The User visits the Account Provider and is unable to
      authenticate.  As part of an account recovery flow, the Account
      Provider sends the user to this endpoint at the Recovery Provider.

   Recover Account endpoints MUST support both the HTTP GET and POST
   methods.

   A query string or "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" formatted POST
   body MAY be provided.  If a query string is provided, it MAY contain
   the parameter "issuer" set to the origin of the Account Provider and/
   or a "id" parameter set to the hex value of a token_id.  These
   parameters can be used by the Recovery Provider to guide the user in
   selecting the correct token.  For example, if used as part of a
   cryptographic key recovery ceremony, it may be necessary to select a
   specific token among several the user has saved from a given issuer.

   Upon receiving an invocation of the Recover Account endpoint the
   Recovery Provider takes the following processing steps:

   1.  Authenticate the user.  The exact nature of how the Recovery
       Provider authenticates the user is beyond the scope of this
       specification.

   2.  Select a token to exercise, based on some combination of user
       choice and input parameters.

   3.  Retrieve the configuration for the token issuer as described in
       Section 2.

   4.  Create a counter-signed token as described in Section 4 and sign
       the token according to the algorithm's requirement.

   5.  Redirect the user agent to the "recover-account-return" endpoint
       defined by the Account Provider configuration.  The "application/
       x-www-form-urlencoded" formatted POST body should include the
       parameter "countersigned-token" set to the countersigned token.

   6.  The Recovery Provider should notify the user, via an out-of-band
       means, that a recovery token has been exercised, for which domain
       and nickname, if applicable.

   7.  If any of these steps fails, abort the algorithm.

3.5.  Recover Account Return Endpoint

   The Recover Account Return endpoint is used to return the User to the
   Account Provider after invoking Recover Account at the Recovery
   Provider.

   Recover Account Return endpoints MUST support the HTTP POST and
   SHOULD reject the HTTP GET method.

   If navigating from a Recovery Provider implemented as a native app to
   a general purpose web browser and POST is not available, the Recovery
   Provider SHOULD first navigate the user agent to a resource under its
   control and use that resource to perform the POST.

   The POST body MUST be "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" formatted.
   It must contain the query parameter "countersigned-token" containing
   the countersigned recovery token.

   Upon receiving an invocation of the Recover Account Return endpoint
   the Account Provider takes the following processing steps:

   1.   Parse the countersigned-token.

   2.   Validate that the version field is 0.

   3.   Validate that the type field is 1.

   4.   De-serialize the original recovery token from the data field.

   5.   Validate the signature on the original recovery token.

   6.   Validate the issuer field is present in the countersigned-token,
        and that it matches the audience field in the original token.

   7.   Validate that the timestamp is fresh within an acceptable closk
        skew.

   8.   Validate the token binding for the countersigned token, if
        present. (the token binding for the inner token is not relevant)

   9.   Optionally, validate that a token with this id has not been
        recently used to recover this account, as an additional
        protection against replay attacks.

   10.  Retrieve the current Recovery Provider configuration as
        described in Section 2.  HTTP redirects SHOULD NOT be followed
        when retrieving the configuration.

   11.  Validate that the issuer field of the retrieved configuration
        matches that of the counter-signed token.

   12.  Validate that the counter-signed token signature validates with
        a current element of the "countersign-pubkeys-secp256r1" array.

   13.  Decrypt the data field from the original recovery token and
        parse its information, if present.

   14.  Apply any additional processing which provider-specific data in
        the opaque data portion may indicate is necessary.

   15.  If all steps have completed successfully, the recovery token may
        be considered to have been successfully applied.  At this point
        the Account Provider may restore control of the account to the
        user.  The details of that process are beyond the scope of this
        specification.  An Account Provider may consider the completion
        of this algorithm as only a single factor in a risk-based
        assessment relating to account recovery and may require
        additional steps to complete the process.  Such decisions and
        steps are beyond the scope of this specification.

   16.  The Account Provider should make a permanent record of the
        recovery noting the Recovery Provider and time of recovery, to
        remediate fraudulent recoveries in the event that a compromise
        is subsequently determined to have occurred at the Recovery
        Provider.

   17.  The Account Provider should notify the User via an out-of-band
        means that an account recovery has occurred.

3.6.  Token Status Endpoint

   The Token Status endpoint is used by the Recovery Provider to notify
   the Account Provider about the current status of a particular token
   in the following cases:

   1.  When a new token is first saved, or fails to save, at the
       Recovery Provider.

   2.  When a token is deleted at the Recovery Provider, or when the
       associated account at the Recovery Provider is deleted or
       deactivated.

   3.  When a token save or recovery action is repudiated by the holder
       of a token at the Recovery Provider.

   The Token Status Callback MUST be hosted at the following well known
   location, relative to the server root of the https origin of the
   Account Provider in the token.

   /.well-known/delegated-account-recovery/token-status

   Token Callback endpoints MUST support both the HTTP "POST" and "GET"
   methods.

3.6.1.  Processing Instructions

   Support for Token Status Callbacks is optional for both the Account
   Provider and Recovery Provider.

   If an Account Provider wishes to receive Token Status Callbacks it
   MUST set the "status_requested" field of the recovery token to 1.

   If an Account Provider does not intend to take action based on Token
   Status Callbacks or wishes to provide additional unlinkability and
   privacy guarantees for a token it SHOULD set the "status_requested"
   field to 0.

   The following token lifecycle events can be reported to an Account
   Provider by a Recovery Provider:

   o  "save-success" reports that a token has been successfully saved
      with the Recovery Provider.

   o  "save-failure" reports that a token was sent to the Recovery
      Provider but was not saved.

   o  "deleted" reports that the user has deleted the token at the
      Recovery Provider.  The Account Provider may want to prompt the
      user to establish a new account recovery capability if the deleted
      token was the only one associated with the account.

   o  "token-repudiated" reports that a user has informed the Recovery
      Provider that a token was associated with their account without
      their consent.

   o  "recovery-repudiated" reports that a user has informed the
      Recovery Provider that a recovery action was initiated with a
      token without their consent.

   When sending a lifecycle event, the Recovery Provider invokes the
   well-known endpoint with a "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
   formatted "POST" body including the parameter "id" set to the hex-
   encoded value of the "token_id" field of the recovery token, and the
   parameter "status" set to the literal ASCII string of the status
   event from the above enumeration. (e.g.  "save-success" or "deleted")

   If the event being reported is "recovery-repudiated" the Recovery
   Provider SHOULD also include a parameter, "countersigned_id", set to
   the hex-encoded value of the "token_id" field for the countersigned
   recovery token associated with the recovery action being repudiated.

3.6.2.  Security Considerations

   Because the Token Status Callback is a direct, server-to-server call,
   hosting this endpoint only at a well-known location reduces the risk
   of Server-Side Request Forgery.

   Although the recommended entropy in the token id should make brute-
   force of fraudulent events difficult, Account Providers might choose
   to only request status callbacks from known Recovery Providers and
   only accept requests from known IP ranges or require additional
   authentication mechanisms beyond the scope of this protocol to
   mitigate risks of forgery and denial-of-service with such requests.

4.  Token Generation

4.1.  Recovery Token

   A Recovery Token is a credential representing the ability to recover
   control of an account.  It is defined as:

   token = base64(token_internals || token_signature)

4.1.1.  Internal Structure

   The internal contents of a token are as follows:


   token_internals = struct {
           uint8    version
           uint8    type
           byte[16] token_id
           uint8    options
           uint16   issuer_length
           string   issuer[issuer_length]
           uint16   audience_length
           string   audience[audience_length]
           unit16   issued_time_length
           string   issued_time[issued_time_length]
           uint16   data_length
           opaque   data[data_length]
           uint16   binding_length
           opaque   binding[binding_length]
    }



   version
       Version identifier.  For this version of the protocol, the value
       MUST be 0.

   type
       Message type.  For the recovery token, the type is 0.

   token_id
       Token identifier.  The identifier SHOULD contain at least 96 bits
       of entropy.  Because tokens may persist for a very long time,
       issuers may wish to use a portion of the token_id field to encode
       an identifier for the keys used originally to sign the token and
       encrypt its data, to assist in revalidation in the event that
       rotations of those keys have occurred since the token was
       originally issued.

   options
       MUST be 0 if the Account Provider does not want status callbacks
       or 1 to request the Recovery Provider to make status callbacks,
       if supported.

   issuer_length
       Length of the issuer field.

   issuer
       The ASCII serialization of the Account Provider's Origin
       [RFC6454]

   audience_length
       Length of the audience field.

   audience
       The contents of the issuer field in the Recovery Provider's
       published configuration.

   issued_time_length
       Length of the issued_time field.

   issued_time
       The ASCII serialization of the time the token was issued,
       represented as an ISO 8601 [ISO.8601.1988]Internet Date/Time
       using the 'date-time' ABNF defined by RFC3339.  [RFC3339]

   data_length
       Length of the data.

   data
       Opaque data.

   binding_length
       Length of the binding.

   binding
       Opaque token binding identifier obtained from the get-token
       endpoint.

4.1.2.  Opaque Data

   The opaque data contains information that the Account Provider needs
   to validate and restore control of an account, but which should not
   be shared with the Recovery Provider.  It MUST be encrypted to
   prevent disclosure of its internal structure.

   Because it is encrypted and opaque, it may contain whatever
   information in whatever format the Account Provider feels is
   necessary and appropriate, but any information beyond that specified
   for inclusion in the outer token MUST be placed in the encrypted
   portion and protected from disclosure to the Recovery Provider.

   Recovery Providers MAY reject a token that is too large.

   The choice of algorithm and key management is left to the discretion
   of the Account Provider.

   A recovery token may still be usable even if an attacker obtains the
   key used to encrypt the opaque data, (though user privacy may be
   compromised) but if the Account Provider loses this key (and the
   ability to decrypt the token data) the account recovery capability
   will be lost.

4.1.3.  Signature

   token_signature is a signature over the token_internals octet string
   as defined according to the version field, with the private key
   corresponding to the public key for the Recovery Provider currently
   published as part of its configuration.

   For this version (0) of the protocol, this is ECDSA over the SHA256
   hash of the token_internals octet string.  The signature is encoded
   as DER-encoded ASN.1 structure (a SEQUENCE of two INTEGERs, for r and
   s, in that order).

4.2.  Counter-Signed Recovery Token

   A Counter-Signed Recovery Token is a credential representing the
   Recovery Provider's re-authentication of the account holder who
   originally saved the Recovery Token it contains.  It is defined as:

   token = base64(countersigned_token_internals ||
   countersigned_token_signature)

4.2.1.  Internal Structure

   The internal contents of a countersigned token are as follows:


   countersigned_token_internals = struct {
           uint8    version
           uint8    type
           byte[16] token_id
           uint8    options
           uint16   issuer_length
           string   issuer[issuer_length]
           uint16   audience_length
           string   audience[audience_length]
           uint16   issued_time_length
           string   issued_time[issued_time_length]
           uint16   data_length
           opaque   data[data_length]
           uint16   binding_length
           opaque   binding[binding_length]
    }



   version
       Version identifier.  For this version of the protocol, the value
       MUST be 0.

   type
       Message type.  For the countersigned recovery token, the type is
       01.

   token_id
       Token identifier.  This SHOULD contain at least 96 bits of
       entropy.

   options
       Reserved.  MUST be 0

   issuer_length
       Length of the issuer field.

   issuer
       The ASCII serialization of the Account Provider's Origin
       [RFC6454]

   audience_length
       Length of the audience field.

   audience
       This SHOULD repeat the contents of the inner recovery token's
       issuer field.

   issued_time_length
       Length of the issued_time field.

   issued_time
       The ASCII serialization of the time this token was issued,
       represented as an ISO 8601 [ISO.8601.1988]Internet Date/Time
       using the 'date-time' ABNF defined by RFC3339.  [RFC3339]

   data_length
       Length of the data.

   data
       The octet string of the original (token_internals ||
       token_signature) as received by the Recovery Provider. (after
       base64 decoding)

   binding_length
       Length of the token binding id.

   binding
       Opaque token binding id obtained from the get-binding endpoint.

4.2.2.  Counter-Signed Recovery Token Signature

   countersigned_token_signature is a signature over the
   countersigned_token_internals octet string as defined according to
   the algorithm field, with the private key corresponding to the public
   key for the Recovery Provider currently published as part of its
   configuration.

   For this version of the protocol (0), the algorithm is ECDSA over the
   SHA256 hash of the countersigned_token_internals octet string.  The
   signature is encoded as DER-encoded ASN.1 structure (a SEQUENCE of
   two INTEGERs, for r and s, in that order)

5.  Use in Key Recovery

   This protocol, in addition to allowing recovery of accounts in a
   delegated fashion, may be used to recover other capabilities, like a
   recovery key for encrypted email or files.  For example, the provider
   of a an encryption service might use a threshold cryptosystem to
   break a key into several parts, and ask the user to store the pieces
   (encoded in the opaque data field) as account recovery tokens at
   several providers.  If the user loses their own copy of the key, they
   can still recover it, but the backup is not subject to server-side
   compromise by any single entity.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Deterministic Use of ECDSA

   As even slight biases in the selection of the random value k used by
   ECDSA can lead to a key compromise.  As such, implementers SHOULD
   follow the method described in [RFC5246] for generating deterministic
   values of k.

6.2.  User Notification

   Users should be notified, by both the Recovery Provider and Account
   Provider, whenever a recovery capability is exercised, in order to
   provide an opportunity to react if they did not initiate the action.
   Out-of-band means (email, instant message, SMS, etc.) should be
   preferred to reduce the opportunity for an attacker in control of a
   user's account to remove such signals.

6.3.  Additional Verification

6.3.1.  At the Recovery Provider

   An explicit goal of this specification is that account recovery
   operations can be explicitly recognized as high-risk operations and
   subject to additional authentication controls by a Recovery Provider.
   Recovery Providers should treat the exercising of a recovery
   capability as a high risk action and require a high degree of
   confidence in the user's authentication to perform it.  The nature of
   this is application-specific at each Recovery Provider.

6.3.1.1.  Session Fixation

   To achieve a convenient and privacy-preserving user experience many
   Recovery Providers will rely on the ambient authority of the user's
   browser (e.g. cookies) to associate a recovery token to their
   account.  If an attacker can execute a session fixation attack on a
   user, in which the user is unknowingly logged out of their account
   and logged in to a different account under the control of an attacker
   (e.g. through a logout/login CSRF attack), and then convince the user
   to save an account recovery token, the attacker may be able to use
   that to take control of the account for which the token grants a
   recovery capability.

   To mitigate this risk, Recovery Providers should take precautions to
   prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery against login/logout endpoints.
   Recovery Providers may also wish to track, for example through
   persistent cookies, which user agents have been used with multiple
   accounts, and require additional confirmation that the user is aware
   of the current logged in user state before saving a recovery token.

6.3.2.  At the Account Provider

   This specification does not mandate that a counter-signed recovery
   token be the exclusive means by which an Account Provider allows
   restoring control or resetting the credentials of an account.  They
   may treat it as only one authentication signal among many possible or
   necessary ones.  Resetting a high-value account might require, e.g.
   multiple instances of this protocol to be completed with independent
   Recovery Providers, or make use of additional authentication factors
   exclusively at the Account Provider.

   Whether to accept or reject a presented counter-signed recovery token
   is always at the discretion of the Account Provider.  Use of this
   protocol does not imply any contract or obligation to honor any
   previously saved recovery capability.

   The opaque data field can be also be used to encapsulate additional
   information to use in strengthening the process.  For example, a
   traditional account recovery "secret question" and its answer might
   be encoded into this data.  This implementation reduces many of the
   risks of such questions, as they cannot be seen or brute-force
   guessed by an attacker that has not already compromised the user's
   account at the Recovery Provider, and the content of such question /
   answer sets cannot leak through a data breach at either the Recovery
   or Account Provider individually.

   If a user recovers their account following a period of compromise,
   the Account Provider should take precautions to invalidate any new
   recovery tokens that may have been issued during the compromise
   period.

6.4.  Cross-Site Request Forgery

   Many web application endpoints require an unforgeable token be sent
   as part of any HTTP POST to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
   attacks from abusing the ambient authority represented by cookies or
   other implicit credentials sent by a web user agent.

   Because the architecture of Delegated Account Recovery relies on
   deliberate cross-origin POSTs, normal protections of this sort cannot
   be applied to the endpoints specified by this specification.

   To prevent abuse, both Account and Recovery Providers should require
   explicit user confirmation of actions in pages that contain anti-
   automation measures, e.g. by setting an X-Frame-Options header
   [RFC7034] or Content-Security-Policy "frame-ancestors" directive to
   prevent clickjacking attacks.

   Initiating sending a recovery token to a recovery provider should be
   protected against Cross-Site Request Forgery and clickjacking, to
   prevent users being tricked into sending tokens to fraudulent
   providers.  Account Providers may want to take special measures to
   require unforgeable user consent or block entirely the delegation of
   tokens to low-reputation Recovery Providers.

6.5.  Breach Detection

   Participants should monitor rates at which recovery capabilities are
   exercised and rates at which users report unauthorized exercising of
   recovery capabilities.  A high rate of unauthorized recovery actions
   initiated at a given Recovery Provider may indicate a compromised or
   malicious provider.  Both Recovery and Account Providers should
   publish contact information for use in incident reporting and
   response.  Verification of token bindings and issued_time freshness
   should also be performed to prevent disclosed tokens from being re-
   associated to new accounts at a Recovery Provider.

6.6.  Clock Skew

   This protocol relies on comparison of timestamps from different
   network servers as a defense-in-depth measure to prevent re-use of
   leaked tokens, in particular re-association of a leaked token with a
   different account at the same audience server.  Although client clock
   skews are a frequent issue for protocols with such dependencies, this
   protocol only depends on reasonable clock synchronization between
   servers, never the user-managed client clock.  Participating servers
   in this protocol should endeavor to issue tokens as close in time to
   when they will be transmitted as possible and should take steps to
   reduce their own clock skew, for example, by periodic synchronization
   with standardized Internet time sources.  The specifics of such
   mechanisms are beyond the scope of this document.

6.7.  Key Loss and Compromise

   This protocol involves three keys: the public/private key pairs of
   the Account and Recovery Providers, and whatever key the Account
   Provider uses to encrypt the opaque data.  Additionally, the recovery
   tokens themselves convey some security capability.  The protocol can
   offer some resilience to loss or compromise of these keys and
   artifacts.

   If the Recovery Provider's key is compromised, it should publicize
   the window in which it was compromised, and should notify Account
   Providers with whom recovery capabilities were exercised during the
   window of compromise.  Mechanisms to communicate this are outside the
   scope of this protocol.  If notified by a Recovery Provider of a key
   compromise, Account Providers should identify recovery capabilities
   exercised from that provider during the window of compromise and
   perform additional diligence for the security of those accounts.
   Generally, if only the Recovery Provider's key is compromised, but
   not the Recovery Provider's other infrastructure around this protocol
   (e.g. if a key was generated using weak entropy but other operational
   procedures were sound) then no attack is possible, since an attacker
   must have both a genuine recovery token and the counter-signing key
   to take over a user's account.  Rotation of the published key is
   sufficient to restore trust for the purposes of this protocol.
   Stored recovery tokens do not need to be re-issued.

   If a set of recovery tokens leak from a Recovery Provider, they do
   not convey any capability without also being countersigned by the
   Recovery Provider's key, and they by themselves convey no personally
   identifying information about the account to which they apply.  So
   long as the Recovery Provider's published key remains secure, leaked
   recovery tokens do not need to be distrusted or re-issued.
   Verification of token bindings and refusal of tokens with a stale
   "issued_time" prior to saving any recovery token can prevent leaked
   tokens from being re-added to different accounts under an attacker's
   control at the same Recovery Provider.

   If an Account Provider loses control of only its token signing key,
   this conveys limited capabilities to the attacker.  It can cause
   false tokens to be stored by a Recovery Provider, but only at an
   account it also controls at the Recovery Provider, and will not have
   the ability to forge the opaque data.  To ensure this resistance, the
   opaque data field should be encrypted using an AEAD mode or other
   encrypt-then-MAC construction to prevent it from being malleable.

   If an Account Provider loses its data encryption keys, tokens issued
   under those keys will be unusable.

6.8.  TLS or HTTPS Certificate Compromise

   This protocol depends on TLS, HTTPS and the Web PKI to bootstrap its
   self-organizing trust framework using HTTPS to distribute keys.
   Because end-users' communication with the network service providers
   in question, including transmission of credentials and session
   management material, also are almost always dependent on TLS and the
   HTTPS Web PKI, there is little value in attempting to eliminate this
   as part of the trusted computing base for this specification.

   Account and Recovery Providers should be cautious in the management
   of the root certification authorities they trust when performing
   configuration discovery operations over HTTPS, should use the latest
   practical TLS version and should terminate the protocol without user
   recourse if any errors are encountered.  Participants may want to
   employ additional means to reduce the risk of compromised HTTPS
   connections that are beyond the scope of this document, such as HTTP
   Public Key Pinning [RFC7469] and Certificate Transparency.  [RFC6962]

6.9.  Token Leakage

   It may be possible that recovery tokens leak to third parties.  Use
   of the POST method and endpoints which are either well-known or
   discovered from the configuration are intended as countermeasures.

   Protocol participants should take additional precautions against
   token leaks in their application-specific logic, such as avoiding
   moving tokens from POST to GET parameters in cleartext during a login
   flow prior to saving a token.

   Use of a token binding can reduce these risks.

7.  Implementation Notes

   This section is non-normative.

   Software platforms may represent Elliptic Curve public keys
   differently.  The configuration encoding required by this
   specification is the format used by OpenSSL's Elliptic Curve
   implementation (X9.62 / RFC 3280), which uses the alias "prime256v1"
   to refer to the NIST secp256r1 curve.  Some software only expects a
   "raw" ECPoint representation as a public key.  If your software's EC
   public key representation is 65 octets long and begins with 0x04,
   this is a raw ECPoint.  Because they are of fixed length, these raw
   points can be converted to the ASN.1 encoded form required by this
   specification by simply prefixing the following 26 octets to the
   buffer:

[48, 89, 48, 19, 6, 7, 42, 134, 72, 206, 61, 2, 1, 6, 8, 42, 134, 72, 206,
61, 3, 1, 7, 3, 66, 0]


8.  IANA Considerations

   Future revisions to this protocol may use a registry to map supported
   cryptographic algorithms to the token version indiator.
