        <section title="Presentation Language">
          <t>This document deals with the formatting of tokens in an external
          representation using a casually defined syntax drawing from that
          used in
          <xref target="RFC5246"></xref> and resembling the programming
          language "C". The purpose is to document the binary token format
          only.</t>
          <t>The basic numeric data type is an unsigned byte (uint8). All
          larger numeric data types are formed from fixed-length series of
          bytes concatenated from left to right and are also unsigned. The
          following numeric types are predefined.</t>
          <figure>

        uint8 uint16[2];
        uint8 uint32[4];
        uint8 uint64[8];
            </artwork>
          </figure>
          <t>All values, here and elsewhere in the specification, are stored
          in network byte (big-endian) order; the uint32 represented by the
          hex bytes 01 02 03 04 is equivalent to the decimal value
          16909060.</t>
          <t>The type string is defined as a concatenated sequence of octet
          sequences representing ASCII characters, one per octet.

          deliberately in preference to "URI" as all such objects in this
          document are used to access network resources and such objects as

      <section title="Challenges with Existing Account Recovery Solutions">
        <t>Network services that rely on user credentials must also cope with
        the reality that users may forget or lose exclusive control of
        these credentials. As a consequence, nearly every such service must
        implement an alternate authentication process to enable a user to
        recover control of an account. In practice, there are few good
        options for doing this, and these recovery flows are often the
        weakest link in securing accounts.</t>
        <section title="Recovery Questions">
          <t>A common and self-contained method of account recovery is to
          ask the user additional questions that they are less likely to
          forget the answer to than a more arbitrary password. The same
          features that make such a question useful for recovery also reduce
          its security:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Things that are memorable may often not be fully private.
            Friends and family members likely know the answers to many such
            questions, and for highly public figures it may be possible to
            research this information.</t>
            <t>Allowing users to select their own questions may result in
            questions with a small possible domain of answers (favorite
            color, favorite superhero) that make brute force guessing highly
            effective, even if rate-limiting is applied.</t>
            <t>Choosing questions that are both secure and memorable is
            difficult, and common choices of subject matter may not be
            applicable across cultural contexts (mother's maiden name, name
            of a pet), age ranges (first car) or other differentiating
            characteristics of large and diverse audiences.</t>
            <t>The limited selection of questions which are both memorable
            and applicable to the broadest possible audience makes re-use of
            these questions and answers common among many service providers,
            with attendant risks that disclosure of answers to a malicious
            party by any provider may compromise many accounts at unrelated
            providers. Furthermore it is difficult for a user to change their
            answers in the event of such a compromise.</t>

        <!-- Recovery Questions -->
        <section title="Password Hints">
          <t>Password hints are extremely problematic - by definition they
          must be revealed to an unauthenticated user, which implies
          reversibly encrypted storage at best, reveals information about a
          password (or often the password itself), and common hints at
          multiple services may reveal where a password is reused,
          facilitating further attacks.</t>
        </section>
        <!-- Password Hints -->
        <section title="Email Recovery">
          <t>Users are unlikely to forget their email address, and a common
          practice is to email the user URL that encodes the ability to
          recover the account. This is the most widely deployed mechanism
          at the time of this writing, but it has a number of shortcomings.
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Forcing users to everywhere use an email address has
            privacy implications, potentially allowing service providers to
            collude to track individuals' activity across many domains.</t>
            <t>Email addresses are not universal, and are becoming less so.
            Especially in the developing world or with younger audiences,
            email may not be the first network service individuals provision
            for themselves, if they provision it at all.</t>
            <t>Email addresses get recycled and reassigned to new owners.</t>
            <t>Users may use a weakly-secured email addresses when signing up
            for a new service, for example an address maintained to collect
            the unwanted commercial correspondence often expected to result
            from signing up for a new online service.</t>
            <t>Email does not provide guarantees of deliverability or
            end-to-end transport security. An adversary performing pervasive
            surveillance may likely be able to abuse such weaknesses.</t>
            <t>Emails in large organizations are rarely private to their
            recipient. In addition to the commonplace that high-value
            accounts belonging to executives may be accessible by their
            assistants, the contents and especially links in the email of
            every user in a modern organization may commonly be logged for legal
            discovery purposes, or crawled to identify malware and phishing
            attacks.</t>
            <t>The capabilities of an emailed reset link must be encoded in
            the GET string to ensure compatibility with non-HTML capable mail
            user agents, and so may leak in the HTTP Referer header to
            any other content included in a recovery page. (e.g. an analytics
            script hosted at a third-party origin)</t>
            <t>Users are commonly authenticated to email services all the
            time on many devices. Account recovery through email is an
            unstructured process which does not ensure the user was strongly
            authenticated for a high-risk action. A simple password
            compromise, or even brief loss of control of an unlocked device
            where the user is logged in, may be sufficient to transitively
            compromise many other accounts of the user. If the only way to
            notify the user that their account was reset is back through the
            same email channel, an attacker can easily cover their
            tracks.</t>
            <t>The wide diversity of mail user agents means that even if
            account recovery emails could be detected heuristically by
            providers or explicitly identified with metadata from senders, it
            would be remain difficult for email providers to apply special
            treatment to such messages.</t>
            <t>An attacker that compromises a user's account may change the
            email address associated with it. Without very carefully designed
            processes, it may be impossible for the genuine user to recover
            their account after such a change if recovery flows are purely
            email-based.</t>
            <t>Email recovery flows cannot be used to recover capabilities,
            such as cryptographic keys, that may be necessary to use an
            account (e.g. a network-based file store that offers encrypted
            files) but which the user does not want the account provider to
            have access to at all times.</t>

        <section title="Federated Authentication">
          <t>Federated systems for authentication take many forms and solve
          the problem of account recovery (or at least delegate it implicitly
          to the Identity Provider). However, after fifteen years of
          widespread deployment of such systems, we see few mainstream
          services that are willing to rely exclusively on federated logins
          for a variety of reasons.
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>A user may be unwilling to disclose their identity, other
            information, or grant permissions to a new service they have just
            begun to use and about which they have not yet formed an opinion
            of its value or trustworthiness.</t>
            <t>A service may be unwilling to depend on a third-party for
            access to its customer base. They may view "owning" their
            relationship with the customer as having business value, may have
            a regulatory mandate to do so, or may not want to be beholden to
            the availability of a third party for their most important
            customer interactions.</t>
            <t>A service may view providers of federated login services as
            competitors or potential competitors, and not wish to disclose
            information about how often users are logging on, who their most
            active users are or not desire to show a competitor's logo as
            part of their login process.</t>

        <!-- Federated Authentication -->
        <section title="Alternate Methods">
          <t>Methods do exist to strongly re-authenticate an account holder
          in the absence of a password or other primary credential.
          Device-based or multi-factor authentication, multi-device
          authentication, or trusted connections in a social network are possibilities.
          Unfortunately, of the potentially hundreds of services a user
          interacts with in a year, only a few are likely able to leverage
          such factors. The rest will lack the information, resources, and user
          consent needed. Furthermore, the characteristics that make good
          recovery systems strong also may make them unique to a particular
          service, preventing broad adoption as a best practice by other
          providers.</t>

      <!-- Challenges with Existing Account Recovery Solutions -->
      <section title="Relationship to Other Protocols">
        <t>Delegated Recovery is similar in some respects to OAuth
        <xref target="RFC5849"></xref>and related protocols.</t>
        <t>It is not constructed simply as a profile of one these protocols
        as it relies on different trust semantics. Because tokens granting an
        account recovery capability are expected to have an indefinite
        lifetime and should be able to remain valid even following the
        compromise and/or rotation of the keys they were originally issued
        under, tokens in this protocol derive their authority at a point in
        time from being signed with currently published public keys,
        discoverable over HTTPS.</t>
        <t>As this trust model is different than other protocols in the broad
        OAuth family, profiling an existing protocol to fit these needs would
        likely be considerably more complex than implementing a new,
        minimalist protocol from scratch. As such, the latter approach has
        been taken here.</t>

      <section title="Goals">
        <t>Goals for Delegated Account Recovery include:

          <t>Allow network services that do not have the resources or
          information to build a secure and usable account recovery process
          to delegate the function to network services that can.</t>
          <t>Allow users to choose to use service providers that can strongly
          re-authenticate them to recover accounts at other services.</t>
          <t>Disclose as little information as possible, and no more than is
          necessary, to protocol participants.</t>
          <t>As much as possible, require multiple points of failure in order
          for accounts to be compromised through the recovery process.</t>
          <t>Be resilient in the face of compromises, including loss of
          exclusive control of cryptographic key material, and allow
          re-establishment of trust in stored recovery capabilities without
          user action.</t>
          <t>Provide, through the protocol semantics, explicit information
          about security-critical account actions and information flow
          between providers to enable better auditing, anomaly detection and
          remediation in the event of compromises.</t>
          <t>Allow users to set up a durable recovery capability when in
          control of their account, which can be exercised even after
          malicious changes to the account (such as changing an associated

            which Recovery Provider they would like to use.</t>
            <t>The Account Provider makes a GET request to determine if the
            service of the user's choice offers the Delegated Recovery service
            and what its protocol endpoint URLs are.  This step may be
            unnecesssary if the Account Provider already knows the configuration
            for the chosen Recovery Provider.</t>
            <t>The Account Provider generates a recovery token for the User
            and Recovery Provider.</t>
            <t>The Account Provider sends the Token to the User Agent with
            instructions to deliver it to the Recovery Provider URL indicated
            in the configuration.</t>
            <t>Upon receiving the Token, the Recovery Provider authenticates
            the user if they are not logged in.</t>
            <t>The Recovery Provider makes a GET request to the Account
            Provider to discover its public keys and protocol URLs.</t>
            <t>The Recovery Provider validates the signature on the token and
            saves it.</t>
            <t>The Recovery Provider optionally notifies the Account Provider
            of the status of the operation.</t>
            <t>The Recovery Provider redirects the user agent back to the
            callback URL indicated by the configuration with a status

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section title="Fetching Configuration">
      <t>Fetching Configuration is the process of determining the
      protocol endpoints and public keys used by Account Providers and Recovery
      Providers.</t>
      <t>Service providers may indicate that configuration responses are
      cacheable and may cache responses but cache lifetimes should be kept
      reasonably short to enable timely responses to events such as key
      compromise.</t>
      <t>Fetching configuration begins by normalizing the service provider to
      be used into an RFC6454<xref target="RFC6454"></xref> ASCII serialization
      of an Origin with an <spanx style="verb">https</spanx>  scheme.</t>
      <t>Retrieval of the configuration is done using an HTTP
      <spanx style="verb">GET</spanx> request to the provider's configuration
      endpoint at the following absolute path relative to the https://
      Origin.
      <vspace />
      <spanx style="verb">
      /.well-known/delegated-account-recovery/configuration</spanx> 
      <vspace /></t>
      <t>The configuration resource path on the http:// scheme MUST NOT
      redirect to the https:// protocol, as this may mask configuration
      mistakes by consumers. Servers MUST return an empty response body and
      an HTTP status code in the 400 range (401 is recommended) if
      <spanx style="verb">
      /.well-known/delegated-account-recovery/configuration</spanx> is
      accessed with the http:// scheme</t>
      <t>When fetching configuration, service providers MUST NOT follow
      redirects that do not use an https:// scheme.  Service providers
      generally should avoid utilizing redirects when returning configuration
      responses.  As it is not mandatory that the issuer field or endpoints in
      a configuration agree with the origin of the configuration URL, directly
      returning the canonical data rather than a redirect reduces latency in
      the protocol.</t>
      <t>A Recovery Provider MUST return the following information in a JSON
      dictionary comprising the entire response body:</t>
      <texttable style="all">
        <ttcol>name</ttcol>
        <ttcol>value</ttcol>
        <c>issuer</c>
        <c>the RFC6454 ASCII Serialization of the Origin to which this

        <c>An array of ECDSA public keys on the secp256r1 curve, encoded
        uncompressed with the named curve OID as per X9.62. The Recovery
        Provider should not publish more than two keys; enabling key rotation
        with a small overlap period is the primary purpose of allowing more
        than one key to be published.</c>

      <t>* NOTE: A Recovery Provider may also impose per-account limitations
      on the total storage or number of recovery tokens it allows. The
      token-max-size property only sets an upper bound on the length of a
      single token, and it may still reject tokens below this bound for
      reasons not discoverable in public configuration.</t>
      <t>An Account Provider MUST return the following information in a JSON

      </texttable>
      <t>An origin that acts as both an Account and a Recovery provider MUST
      return a single JSON dictionary as the entire response body containing

      <t>URLs
      <xref target="RFC3986"></xref>MUST have a scheme component that is
      <spanx style="verb">https</spanx>, a host component, and optionally,

      that no relationship can be assumed between the host component of the
      <spanx style="verb">issuer</spanx> input and those of of the URLs in the

    </section>
    <!-- Recovery Configuration Discovery -->
    <section title="Protocol Endpoints">
      <t>Each phase (establishing, and exercising, an account recovery
      capability) utilizes three protocol endpoints. (HTTP resources)</t>
      <t>All protocol endpoints MUST use the https:// scheme, and the
      protocol endpoint paths at the http:// scheme MUST NOT redirect to the
      https:// protocol, as this may mask configuration mistakes by clients.
      A GET or POST to protocol endpoint paths using the http:// scheme MUST
      yield an empty response body and an HTTP status code 401.</t>
      <t>When establishing a recovery capability, the following endpoints are
      used:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>
        <spanx style="verb">Save Token</spanx> at the Recovery Provider is the
        endpoint to which the Account Provider will instruct the user agent
        to deliver the Recovery Token.</t>
        <t>
        <spanx style="verb">Save Token Async IFrame API</spanx> is a URL
        from which an HTML resource supporting an async postMessage API
        for saving tokens can be loaded.
        </t>
        <t>
        <spanx style="verb">Save Token Return</spanx> is the endpoint at the
        Account Provider where the Recovery Provider redirects the user agent
        after processing an invocation of the
        <spanx style="verb">Save Token</spanx> endpoint.</t>
      </list></t>
      <t>When exercising a recovery capability, the following endpoints are
      used:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>
        <spanx style="verb">Recover Account</spanx> at the Recovery Provider
        is the endpoint at which the User will initiate an account recovery
        action at an Account Provider. The User may be directed to this
        resource by the Recovery Provider, or the Account Provider may
        utilize published configuration to direct the User to this
        endpoint.</t>
        <t>
        <spanx style="verb">Recover Account Return</spanx> is the endpoint at
        the Account Provider where the Recovery Provider redirects the user
        agent with a counter-signed recovery token to complete the recovery
        of their account</t>
      </list></t>
      <t>Additionally, an Account Provider may optionally provide a "Token
      Status" endpoint at a well-known location to allow the Recovery
      Provider to provide direct status updates for tokens, such as the
      success or failure of saving a token, token deletion, or repudiation of
      the exercise of a recovery capability.</t>
      <section title="Save Token Endpoint">
        <t><spanx style="verb">save-token</spanx> is used to interact
        with the Recovery Provider and save a recovery token for later use.
        The Recovery Provider MUST first
        authenticate the User. The way in which the Recovery Provider
        authenticates the User is beyond the scope of this specification.</t>
        <t>Save Token endpoints which expect to receive invocations by web
        user agents MUST support the HTTP "POST" method and SHOULD reject the
        HTTP "GET" method.</t>
        <t>If navigating from an Account Provider implemented as a native app
        to a general purpose web browser and POST is not available, the
        Account Provider SHOULD first navigate the user agent to a resource
        under its control and use that resource to perform the POST.</t>
        <t>The POST body MUST be
        <spanx style="verb">
        application/x-www-form-urlencoded</spanx> formatted. It MUST contain
        a parameter
        <spanx style="verb">token</spanx> containing the recovery token.</t>
        <t>The POST body MAY contain the additional parameter 'login_hint'.
        This value may be set to indicate the Account
        Provider's notion of the primary contact point for the user. A
        Recovery Provider might match this against the currently logged
        in user to determine what UI treatments, if any, to apply to
        confirm saving of the recovery token.</t>
        <t>The POST body MAY contain the additional parameter 'login_hint_sha256'.
        This value may be set to indicate the Account Provider's notion of the
        primary contact point for the user.  A Recovery Provider might match 
        this against the currently logged in user to determine what UI treatments,
        if any, to apply to confirm saving of the recovery token.
        The value should contain the base64 encoded concatenation of a 256 bit
        random salt value with the binary output of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm
        applied to the concatenation of the salt and an octet string representing
        the ASCII serialization of the primary contact point hint for the user
        at the Account Provider.  Use of 'login_hint_sha256', when compared to
        'login_hint', allows matching without disclosure, but introduces the
        possibility that legitimate matches will not be discovered due to
        differences in how contact point hints are represented or canonicalized
        before hashing.</t>
        <t>The POST body MAY contain an additional parameter
        'nickname_hint' to suggest a nickname for the account to which
        the token relates.</t>
        <t>The POST body MAY contain an additional parameter 'confirmation'. If
        set to the value 'required', this indicates to the Recovery Provider
        that it SHOULD show some form of interstitial explicitly informing
        the user that a token will be saved, with the option to decline.</t>
				<t>The POST body type MAY contain an additional parameter, 'obsoletes'.
				The value of the 'obsoletes' is a token id which the current
				token is intended to replace.  If the user at the Recovery Provider
				has a saved token with an id and issuer matching this property,
				it should be deleted or marked as invalid if the new token is
				successfully saved.</t>
        <t>The POST body MAY contain an additional parameter 'state', the
        value of which will be passed to the 'save-token-return' endpoint,
        unmodified.</t>

          <t>When a user wishes to save a recovery token, the Account

            entering a domain name, or it might be inferred from the
            domain portion of an email address.</t>
            <t>Retrieve the Recovery Provider configuration as described in
            Section 2.</t>
            <t>If necessary configuration cannot be obtained, abort these

            <t>Prepare a recovery token as described in Section 4. Use

              value of the 'audience' field in the token.</t>
            <t>The Account Provider may save the token_id and audience
            fields from the token associated with the User's account, to
            assist the user in completing a recovery process at a future
            time.</t>
            <t>The Account Provider should have some method of mapping an
            issued recovery token to the original public key it was issued
            under and any key used to encrypt the opaque data, to be able
            to complete the protocol when the token is returned. This might
            be maintained as server-side state, or key ids might be encoded
            into the token_id field.</t>
            <t>Instruct the user's agent to POST the token to the Save Token

          <t>Upon receiving an invocation of the Save Token endpoint the
          Recovery Provider takes the following processing steps:

            Provider authenticates the User is beyond the scope of this

            HTTP redirects SHOULD NOT be followed.</t>
            <t>Validate that the value of the issuer field of the configuration
            matches the value of the issuer field of the recovery token.</t>
            <t>Validate the signature over the token according to processing
            rules for the algorithm implied by the version.</t>
            <t>Validate that the audience field of the token identifies an
            origin which the provider considers itself authoritative for.
            (Often the audience will be same-origin with the Recovery
            Provider, but other values may be acceptable, e.g.
            "https://mail.example.com" and "https://social.example.com" may
            be acceptable audiences for "https://recovery.example.com".)</t>
            <t>Validate that the timestamp is fresh within an acceptable clock skew.</t>
            <t>If a token binding is present or required, validate that it is acceptable.</t>
            <t>Save the token for the User. The means by which a Recovery
            Provider saves the token is beyond the scope of this
            specification.</t>
            <t>Because recovery tokens do not reveal the account name at the
            Account Provider, and because a User might have multiple
            accounts, Recovery Providers may give the User an option to
            add attach a nickname (e.g. "home", "work") or other means of
            identifying the account the token is associated with.</t>
            <t>When the user has completed the operation successfully, or if
            the user aborted or abandoned the operation, or if the operation
            cannot be completed due to an unrecoverable error, if the token's

            <spanx style="verb">status_requested</spanx> field is 1, the

        <t>The details of how such a resource communicates with services at

          <t>For messages that elicit a response, the Account Provider may

            These values may be set to indicate the Account

            can redirect the parent window to whatever location is necessary to
            complete the flow interactively at the Recovery Provider.
            It SHOULD always attempt to return the user to the Account
            Provider's save-token-return endpoint at the end of these flows,

            it might dispatch them immediately using an API like Beacon, if
            available, or it may need to make an asynchronous HTTP request
            and wait for a response. It SHOULD indicate "done" to the caller
            at the earliest practical moment.</t>
            <t>This protocol message would typically be employed with a token

            an account. It might be used to optimistically enroll users in
            recovery as part of another action, with an offer to complete the

      <section title="Recover Account Return Endpoint">
        <t>The Recover Account Return endpoint is used to return the User to the Account
        Provider after invoking Recover Account at the Recovery Provider.</t>
        <t>Recover Account Return endpoints MUST support the HTTP POST
        and SHOULD reject the HTTP GET method.</t>
        <t>If navigating from a Recovery Provider implemented as a native app
        to a general purpose web browser and POST is not available, the
        Recovery Provider SHOULD first navigate the user agent to a resource
        under its control and use that resource to perform the POST.</t>
        <t>The POST body MUST be
        <spanx style="verb">
        application/x-www-form-urlencoded</spanx> formatted. It must contain
        the query parameter
        <spanx style="verb">countersigned-token</spanx> containing the
        countersigned recovery token.</t>
        <t>Upon receiving an invocation of the Recover Account Return endpoint the
        Account Provider takes the following processing steps:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Parse the countersigned-token.</t>
          <t>Validate that the version field is 0.</t>
          <t>Validate that the type field is 1.</t>
          <t>De-serialize the original recovery token from the data
          field.</t>
          <t>Validate the signature on the original recovery token.</t>
          <t>Validate the issuer field is present in the
          countersigned-token, and that it matches the audience field in the
          original token.</t>
          <t>Validate that the timestamp is fresh within an acceptable closk skew.</t>
          <t>Validate the token binding for the countersigned token, if
          present. (the token binding for the inner token is not relevant)</t>
          <t>Optionally, validate that a token with this id has not been recently used
          to recover this account, as an additional protection against replay attacks.</t>
          <t>Retrieve the current Recovery Provider configuration as
          described in Section 2.  HTTP redirects SHOULD NOT be followed when retrieving
          the configuration.</t>
          <t>Validate that the issuer field of the retrieved configuration matches that
          of the counter-signed token.</t>
          <t>Validate that the counter-signed token signature validates with
          a current element of the
          <spanx style="verb">countersign-pubkeys-secp256r1</spanx> array.</t>
          <t>Decrypt the data field from the original recovery token and
          parse its information, if present.</t>
          <t>Apply any additional processing which provider-specific data in
          the opaque data portion may indicate is necessary.</t>
          <t>If all steps have completed successfully, the recovery token may
          be considered to have been successfully applied. At this point the
          Account Provider may restore control of the account to the user.
          The details of that process are beyond the scope of this
          specification. An Account Provider may consider the completion of
          this algorithm as only a single factor in a risk-based assessment
          relating to account recovery and may require additional steps to
          complete the process. Such decisions and steps are beyond the scope
          of this specification.</t>
          <t>The Account Provider should make a permanent record of the
          recovery noting the Recovery Provider and time of recovery, to
          remediate fraudulent recoveries in the event that a compromise is
          subsequently determined to have occurred at the Recovery
          Provider.</t>
          <t>The Account Provider should notify the User via an out-of-band
          means that an account recovery has occurred.</t>

          <t>The following token lifecycle events can be reported to an
          Account Provider by a Recovery Provider:

            <spanx style="verb">deleted</spanx> reports that the user has
            deleted the token at the Recovery Provider. The Account Provider
            may want to prompt the user to establish a new account recovery
            capability if the deleted token was the only one associated with
            the account.</t>
            <t>

      <t>This protocol, in addition to allowing recovery of accounts in a
      delegated fashion, may be used to recover other capabilities, like a
      recovery key for encrypted email or files. For example, the provider of
      a an encryption service might use a threshold cryptosystem to break a
      key into several parts, and ask the user to store the pieces (encoded
      in the opaque data field) as account recovery tokens at several
      providers. If the user loses their own copy of the key, they can still
      recover it, but the backup is not subject to server-side compromise by

      <section title="User Notification">
        <t>Users should be notified, by both the Recovery Provider and
        Account Provider, whenever a recovery capability is exercised, in order
        to provide an opportunity to react if they did not initiate the action.
        Out-of-band means (email, instant message, SMS, etc.) should be
        preferred to reduce the opportunity for an attacker in control of a
        user's account to remove such signals.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Additional Verification">
        <section title="At the Recovery Provider">
          <t>An explicit goal of this specification is that account recovery
          operations can be explicitly recognized as high-risk operations and
          subject to additional authentication controls by a Recovery
          Provider. Recovery Providers should treat the exercising of a
          recovery capability as a high risk action and require a high degree
          of confidence in the user's authentication to perform it. The
          nature of this is application-specific at each Recovery
          Provider.</t>
          <section title="Session Fixation">
            <t>To achieve a convenient and privacy-preserving user experience
            many Recovery Providers will rely on the ambient authority of the
            user's browser (e.g. cookies) to associate a
            recovery token to their account. If an attacker can execute a
            session fixation attack on a user, in which the user is
            unknowingly logged out of their account and logged in to a
            different account under the control of an attacker (e.g. through
            a logout/login CSRF attack), and then convince the user to save
            an account recovery token, the attacker may be able to use that
            to take control of the account for which the token grants a
            recovery capability.</t>
            <t>To mitigate this risk, Recovery Providers should take
            precautions to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery against
            login/logout endpoints. Recovery Providers may also wish to
            track, for example through persistent cookies, which user agents
            have been used with multiple accounts, and require additional
            confirmation that the user is aware of the current logged in user
            state before saving a recovery token.</t>
          </section>
        </section>
        <!-- At the Recovery Provider -->
        <section title="At the Account Provider">
          <t>This specification does not mandate that a counter-signed
          recovery token be the exclusive means by which an Account Provider
          allows restoring control or resetting the credentials of an
          account. They may treat it as only one authentication signal among
          many possible or necessary ones. Resetting a high-value account
          might require, e.g. multiple instances of this protocol to be
          completed with independent Recovery Providers, or make use of
          additional authentication factors exclusively at the Account
          Provider.</t>
          <t>Whether to accept or reject a presented counter-signed recovery
          token is always at the discretion of the Account Provider. Use of
          this protocol does not imply any contract or obligation to honor
          any previously saved recovery capability.</t>
          <t>The opaque data field can be also be used to encapsulate
          additional information to use in strengthening the process. For
          example, a traditional account recovery "secret question" and its
          answer might be encoded into this data. This implementation reduces
          many of the risks of such questions, as they cannot be seen or
          brute-force guessed by an attacker that has not already compromised
          the user's account at the Recovery Provider, and the content of
          such question / answer sets cannot leak through a data breach at
          either the Recovery or Account Provider individually.</t>
          <t>If a user recovers their account following a period of
          compromise, the Account Provider should take precautions to
          invalidate any new recovery tokens that may have been issued during
          the compromise period.</t>

      <section title="Low Friction Tokens and Delegated Multi-Factor Authentication">
        <t>Generally, recovering an account is a high-security event, and
        a key advantage of this protocol is that it identifies recoveries
        explicitly, so they may have appropriate re-authentication and
        rate limiting applied by a Recovery Provider.</t>
        <t>However, the ability to anonymously attest continuity of control of
        an account at an external source has other uses beyond recovering account
        using this protocol as the sole source of evidence.</t>
        <t>If an Account Provider sets the "Low Friction" bit in the token
        options bitflag, it is indicating to the Recovery Provider that the
        token will not be treated as a single authentication factor, and so request
        that ease of use in "recovery" be prioritized over additional security measures
        or strict rate limting.  In this mode, the protcol may be used as a generalized
        part of a multi-factor authentication solution, replacing solutions like one-time
        passwords with a decentralized mesh of user accounts.</t>
        <t>When a Recovery Provider receives a token with the Low Friction flag set, it
        SHOULD adjust rate limts and re-authentication strategies to prioritize user success
        and ease of use above the level of authentication assurance.  It SHOULD then set the
        same flag in the Countersigned Token it issues.</t>
        <t>Additionally, a Recovery Provider MAY use the Low Friction flag in a Countersigned
        Token to indicate to an Account Provider that, despite best efforts for a Recovery Token
        where the Low Friction flag was not set, a strong level of authentication assurance was
        not possible.  It is at the discretion of the Recovery Provider exactly what
        this means, but suggested that this flag be set when the level of authentication possible
        was no stronger than username/password.  This SHOULD only be used when
        stronger challenges are not available due to the configuration of the account at the
        Recovery Provider.  If a strong authentication challenge was available but could not be
        completed, the Recovery Provider should not issue a Countersigned Token.</t>
      </section>
      <!-- Low Friction Tokens -->
      <section title="Cross-Site Request Forgery">
        <t>Many web application endpoints require an unforgeable token be
        sent as part of any HTTP POST to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery
        (CSRF) attacks from abusing the ambient authority represented by
        cookies or other implicit credentials sent by a web user agent.</t>
        <t>Because the architecture of Delegated Account Recovery relies on
        deliberate cross-origin POSTs, normal protections of this sort cannot
        be applied to the endpoints specified by this specification.</t>
        <t>To prevent abuse, both Account and Recovery Providers should
        require explicit user confirmation of actions in pages that contain
        anti-automation measures, e.g. by setting an X-Frame-Options header
        <xref target="RFC7034"></xref> or Content-Security-Policy "frame-ancestors"
        directive to prevent clickjacking attacks.</t>
        <t>Initiating sending a recovery token to a recovery provider
        should be protected against Cross-Site Request Forgery and
        clickjacking, to prevent users being tricked into sending tokens to
        fraudulent providers. Account Providers may want to take special
        measures to require unforgeable user consent or block entirely the
        delegation of tokens to low-reputation Recovery Providers.</t>
      </section>
      <!-- Cross-Site Request Forgery -->
      <section title="Breach Detection">
        <t>Participants should monitor rates at which recovery capabilities
        are exercised and rates at which users report unauthorized exercising
        of recovery capabilities. A high rate of unauthorized recovery
        actions initiated at a given Recovery Provider may indicate a
        compromised or malicious provider. Both Recovery and Account Providers
        should publish contact information for use in incident reporting and
        response. Verification of token bindings and issued_time freshness
        should also be performed to prevent disclosed tokens from being
        re-associated to new accounts at a Recovery Provider.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Clock Skew">
        <t>This protocol relies on comparison of timestamps from different
        network servers as a defense-in-depth measure to prevent re-use of
        leaked tokens, in particular re-association of a leaked token with a
        different account at the same audience server. Although client clock
        skews are a frequent issue for protocols with such dependencies, this
        protocol only depends on reasonable clock synchronization between
        servers, never the user-managed client clock. Participating servers
        in this protocol should endeavor to issue tokens as close in time to
        when they will be transmitted as possible and should take steps to
        reduce their own clock skew, for example, by periodic synchronization
        with standardized Internet time sources. The specifics of such
        mechanisms are beyond the scope of this document.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Key Loss and Compromise">
        <t>This protocol involves three keys: the public/private key pairs of
        the Account and Recovery Providers, and whatever key the Account
        Provider uses to encrypt the opaque data. Additionally, the recovery
        tokens themselves convey some security capability. The protocol can
        offer some resilience to loss or compromise of these keys and
        artifacts.</t>
        <t>If the Recovery Provider's key is compromised, it should publicize
        the window in which it was compromised, and should notify Account
        Providers with whom recovery capabilities were exercised during the
        window of compromise. Mechanisms to communicate this are outside the
        scope of this protocol. If notified by a Recovery Provider of a key
        compromise, Account Providers should identify recovery capabilities
        exercised from that provider during the window of compromise and
        perform additional diligence for the security of those accounts.
        Generally, if only the Recovery Provider's key is compromised, but
        not the Recovery Provider's other infrastructure around this protocol
        (e.g. if a key was generated using weak entropy but other operational
        procedures were sound) then no attack is possible, since an attacker
        must have both a genuine recovery token and the counter-signing key
        to take over a user's account. Rotation of the published key is
        sufficient to restore trust for the purposes of this protocol. Stored
        recovery tokens do not need to be re-issued.</t>
        <t>If a set of recovery tokens leak from a Recovery Provider, they do
        not convey any capability without also being countersigned by the
        Recovery Provider's key, and they by themselves convey no personally
        identifying information about the account to which they apply.
        So long as the Recovery Provider's published key remains secure, leaked
        recovery tokens do not need to be distrusted or re-issued.
        Verification of token bindings and refusal of tokens with a stale
        <spanx style="verb">issued_time</spanx> prior to saving any recovery
        token can prevent leaked tokens from being re-added to different
        accounts under an attacker's control at the same Recovery
        Provider.</t>
        <t>If an Account Provider loses control of only its token signing
        key, this conveys limited capabilities to the attacker. It can cause
        false tokens to be stored by a Recovery Provider, but only at an
        account it also controls at the Recovery Provider, and will not have
        the ability to forge the opaque data. To ensure this resistance, the
        opaque data field should be encrypted using an AEAD mode or other
        encrypt-then-MAC construction to prevent it from being malleable.</t>
        <t>If an Account Provider loses its data encryption keys, tokens issued
        under those keys will be unusable.</t>

      <!-- Key Loss and Compromise -->
      <section title="TLS or HTTPS Certificate Compromise">
        <t>This protocol depends on TLS, HTTPS and the Web PKI to bootstrap
        its self-organizing trust framework using HTTPS to distribute keys.
        Because end-users' communication with the network service providers
        in question, including transmission of credentials and session
        management material, also are almost always dependent on TLS and the
        HTTPS Web PKI, there is little value in attempting to eliminate this
        as part of the trusted computing base for this specification.</t>
        <t>Account and Recovery Providers should be cautious in the
        management of the root certification authorities they trust when
        performing configuration discovery operations over HTTPS, should use
        the latest practical TLS version and should terminate the protocol
        without user recourse if any errors are encountered. Participants may
        want to employ additional means to reduce the risk of compromised
        HTTPS connections that are beyond the scope of this document, such as

      representation as a public key. If your software's EC public key
      representation is 65 octets long and begins with 0x04, this is a raw
      ECPoint. Because they are of fixed length, these raw points can be
      converted to the ASN.1 encoded form required by this specification by
      simply prefixing the following 26 octets to the buffer:</t>
